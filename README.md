This insight allows you to search and group users based on their
events and properties. Multiple terms can be combined to form both
disjunctive (OR) and conjunctive (AND) queries. In addition,
negations can be created with the NOT operator.

The results are displayed as a bar chart displaying the amount of
users matching each query. Each resulting group can be extracted as a
user segment and used in combination with other insights.
