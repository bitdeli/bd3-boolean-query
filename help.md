This insight allows you to search and group users based on their
events and properties. Multiple terms can be combined to form both
disjunctive (OR) and conjunctive (AND) queries. In addition,
negations can be created with the NOT operator.

Start the query by entering a property or event name in the
text field below. Pressing the down arrow shows a list of all
possible options based on the source data. A query can also be
started with the "NOT" keyword to exclude users with certain
properties. After entering the property name you can enter its value
to perform the query.

Multiple terms can be combined by writing them in the same field. Add
queries by writing them in the last empty field. Terms and queries
can be removed by clicking the "Ã—" icons inside the fields or by
pressing backspace.

The results are displayed as a bar chart displaying the amount of
users matching each query. Each resulting group can be extracted as a
user segment and used in combination with other insights.

**Example:** Find out which site brings you most referral traffic by
entering "referring\_domain=facebook.com" and
"referring\_domain=t.co" (Twitter) as the queries (actual
property names and values depend on your source data). Create
segments from each user group and use the *Events Funnel* insight to
see how the referrer affects their conversion rate.
